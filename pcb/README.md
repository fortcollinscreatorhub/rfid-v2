# PCB (circuit board)

The PCB was developed using KiCAD 7.0.11 under Ubuntu.

Prototype versions of the PCB were manufactured by
[OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/). The KiCAD PCB file was uploaded directly, as
opposed to exporting Gerber files, etc.

A production run of the PCB was manufactured by [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/), using the
Gerber files in directory `gerber-20250210/`.
